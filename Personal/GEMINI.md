### 1. Purpose of this Workspace

This is your personal workspace for tasks, learning, and experiments that are not tied to a specific client or internal project. You can use this space for:

*   Drafting notes and ideas.
*   Tracking personal to-do items.
*   Experimenting with new technologies or code.
*   Storing useful snippets and commands.

### 2. My Behavior in this Workspace

*   I will adopt a more informal and direct tone.
*   I will prioritize quick execution and iteration over formal processes.
*   I will assume the context is your personal work unless you state otherwise.

### 3. Key Documents & Links

*   **Original Project File:** [Personal.md](Personal.md)

> **Note:** This file, `GEMINI.md`, is the official context file for this workspace. The original `Personal.md` is preserved for historical reference.
