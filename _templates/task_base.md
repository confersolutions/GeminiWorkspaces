# Task {{TASK_ID}} — {{TASK_TITLE}}
Status: In Progress
Last updated: November 9, 2025, 14:20:02 CST

## Objective
Briefly describe what needs to be achieved.

## Subtasks
- [ ] {{TASK_ID}}.1 — (first step)
- [ ] {{TASK_ID}}.2 — (second step)
- [ ] {{TASK_ID}}.3 — (verification/test)

## Updates
> Use `UPDATE TASK` or `COMPLETE TASK` to append progress.
Updates are meant to be **user-facing progress notes**:
- What was completed.
- Which subtasks moved forward.
- Milestones, deliverables, and status changes.

### {{DATE_TIME_CST}}
- Task initialized from `_templates/task_base.md`.

## Session History
> Use `STORE HISTORY` or `STORE CONTEXT` to summarize reasoning and conversation.
Session History is for **AI reasoning and conversational context**:
- Why certain decisions were made.
- Experiments that were tried (even if they failed).
- Important reasoning steps that may be needed in the future.
Think of `## Updates` as “what shipped” and `## Session History` as “how we thought about it.”
