# Meta-Workspace Guide: _templates

### 1. Purpose of this Directory

This `_templates/` directory is a meta-workspace. It does not contain a work project but instead holds reusable templates, boilerplate files, and action snippets that I, Gemini, use to standardize file creation across all workspaces.

### 2. How to Use Templates

When creating a new project, task, or document, you can instruct me to use a file from this directory as a starting point. For example: "Create a new task for the MoXi project using the `task_base.md` template."

### 3. Naming Conventions

*   Templates should have descriptive names.
*   End filenames with `_template.md` or a similar suffix where appropriate (e.g., `project_brief_template.md`).

### 4. Index of Actions

The `actions_index.md` file serves as a manifest for reusable commands or "actions" that I can perform.

**Rule:** Whenever a new action template is added to this directory, you must update `actions_index.md` to make the action discoverable.
