## 🧭 Purpose

This file captures the complete working context of a prior AI session so it can be reloaded into any AI environment.  
When provided to an AI, it should instantly restore awareness of:
- What project and objectives were being worked on  
- What progress has been made so far  
- What conventions, decisions, and structures are already in place  
- What the next logical steps are  

Use this as the canonical record for project continuity.
