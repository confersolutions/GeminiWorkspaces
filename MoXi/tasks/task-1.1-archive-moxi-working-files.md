# Task 1.1 — Archive MoXi Working Files
Status: Completed
Last updated: 2025-11-09 15:14:52 CST

## Objective
Safely archive key MoXi working and reference files into a new folder and verify the remaining file count.

The work will be performed in:
`/Users/yatinkarnik/Workspace/GeminiWorkspaces/MoXi/MoXi Website Chatbot 2.0 112025-2/`

After archiving, the total number of files remaining in the base folder should be **27**, excluding the archived files.

## Subtasks
- [x] **1.1.1 — Create Archive Folder**  
      Create a new subfolder:  
      `/Users/yatinkarnik/Workspace/GeminiWorkspaces/MoXi/MoXi Website Chatbot 2.0 112025-2/New Archive/`
- [x] **1.1.2 — Move Files to Archive Folder**  
      Move the following files into the new folder:
      - `MoXi Bot Instructions Personality.docx`
      - `Contradictions Log` (any variant name)
      - `Worklog`
      - `Verification Report`
      - `PACKAGE_CONTENTS.md`
- [x] **1.1.3 — Verify File Transfer**  
      Ensure all 5 files exist in `/New Archive/` and no longer exist in the base directory.
- [x] **1.1.4 — Count Remaining Files**  
      Count how many files remain in `/Users/yatinkarnik/Workspace/GeminiWorkspaces/MoXi/MoXi Website Chatbot 2.0 112025-2/`  
      (excluding `/New Archive/`) and confirm the count is **27**.
- [x] **1.1.5 — Log Results**  
      Record the final file count under `## Updates`.
