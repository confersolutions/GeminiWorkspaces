# Master Task List — MoXi
Last updated: 2025-11-09 15:33:12 CST

This file provides a high-level overview of major tasks for the MoXi project. Each major task (e.g., Task 1, Task 2) may have multiple detailed subtask files (e.g., task-1.1-*.md, task-1.2-*.md) located in the `/tasks/` folder.

## How This Works

- **Major Tasks** are listed in the table below with overall status.
- Each major task links to its detailed subtask file(s).
- A major task is marked `Completed` only when ALL its subtasks (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4) are completed.
- Subtask files contain the detailed work, updates, and session history.
- This master list serves as the quick-reference index.

## Task Overview

| Task # | Description | Status | Linked Files |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Archive MoXi working files | Completed | [task-1.1](task-1.1-archive-moxi-working-files.md) |
<!-- Add new tasks below as they are identified -->

## Status Legend

- **Not Started**: Task not yet begun
- **In Progress**: At least one subtask is active or completed, but not all subtasks are done
- **Completed**: All subtasks for this major task are completed
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to external dependency
- **On Hold**: Paused temporarily

## Notes

- Add rows to the table as new major tasks are identified.
- Update the "Linked Files" column when new subtask files are created.
- Update "Status" when subtask completion changes the overall state.
- Keep this file synchronized with actual task files in `/tasks/`.
